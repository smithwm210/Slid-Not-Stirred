# Slid-Not-Stirred

A duel between two bartenders to see who can their client drunk first
Made for IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, whose theme was Don't Stop!
As part of the Game Jam, we were given some fun restrictions:
  - all sound effects had to originate from our voices
  - nothing was allowed to be harmed in our game
