# Slid Not Stirred

A duel between two bartenders to see who can their client drunk first


Made for IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, whose theme was Don't Stop!
As part of the Game Jam, we were given some fun restrictions:
  - All sound effects had to originate from our voices
  - Nothing in the game could be harmed
  - A mute button that makes the screen go black and continue to play sounds
  - Poorly translated subtitles for every sound effect
  - A prominent animation made in MS paint
