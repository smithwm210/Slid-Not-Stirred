# Slid Not Stirred

A loyal glass of alcohol must dodge obstacles to get back to the bartender


The winning game of IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, whose theme was Don't Stop!
As part of the Game Jam, we were given some fun restrictions:
  - All sound effects had to originate from our voices
  - Nothing in the game could be harmed
  - Include a mute button that makes the screen go black
  - Poorly translated subtitles for every sound effect
  - A prominent animation made in MS paint
